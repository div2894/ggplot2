We will use the cities network data as provided via https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/netdata/html/cities.html. Read the cities network into R via the provided Rdata file. Then recreate the graph provided in the PPT. Set a seed to 1 before creating the graph to recreate the graph exactly.
```{r problem 1}
library(sna)
library(GGally)
load("cities.RData")
set.seed(1)

ggnet2(net= cities,
       label = TRUE,
       label.size = 3,
       edge.color = "red",
       size = "degree", 
       size.min = 36, 
       size.max = 55)




```
